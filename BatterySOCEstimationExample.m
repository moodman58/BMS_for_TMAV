%% Battery State-of-Charge Estimation
% This example shows how to estimate the battery state-of-charge (SOC) by 
% using a Kalman filter. The initial SOC of the battery is equal to 0.5. 
% The estimator uses an initial condition for the SOC equal to 0.8. The 
% battery keeps charging and discharging for 6 hours. The extended Kalman 
% filter estimator converges to the real value of the SOC in less than 10 
% minutes and then follows the real SOC value. To use a different Kalman 
% filter implementation, in the SOC Estimator (Kalman Filter) block, set 
% the Filter type parameter to the desired value.
